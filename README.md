"# LogisticRegression_from_Scratch" 

## Logistic Regression:
Definition: Logistic Regression is a statistical model commonly used in machine learning for classification problems. Despite its name, it is not a regression algorithm but rather a predictive modeling technique designed for binary or multi-class classification tasks.

## The Goal:
The primary objective of implementing the statistical model (Logistic Regression) from scratch is to gain a deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms. By avoiding libraries such as Scikit-learn or other ML/DL tools, the focus is on understanding how the model is formulated, trained, and makes predictions.
